# Demo_Backsliding
This repository consists of my research, code, simulation, and the final product which became my Master's Thesis titled "To Catch A Dictator: How to Identify Backsliding
Governments?". The idea inherently was to make a mathematical model to predict and analyze the optimal paths of information suppression for different forms of government (Liberal Democracy, partial democracy, pure totalitarianism, etc.). These forms of government are represented on a continuous scale.

The information generation happens on a (pseudo-)random basis, and the paper presents mathematical functions that chart out the path of dynamically backsliding governments, how the paths are impacted due to the democratic factor, and how their responses are different to the same degree of negative, positive or neutral information. 

The essay ends with a view on the current domestic and international legal frameworks to protect liberal democracies, and specifically take notice of the vagueness of it. I also bring about the case study of Hungary and how the setup of autocratic governments may differ from the mid-to-late 20th century, and how gradual democratic backsliding is the new tool of the would-be autocrats. 

In the repository, I have added my thesis, the (rough) simulation code I ran, and the graphs documenting the results. All explanations are in the thesis, regarding certain decisions that were taken about the simulation. In the appendix of the thesis, you will find the mathematical proofs for the equation used and the functional behavior fitting our requirements for the use-case.
